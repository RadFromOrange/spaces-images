# Complete OpenJDK + Eclipse setup

[These OpenJDK + Eclipse combination images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?tab=packages&repo_name=spaces-images&q=OpenJDK+Eclipse)
provide complete OpenJDK + Eclipse development environments (IDE, CLIs, settings, etc.),
which should enable most OpenJDK developers to be productive in itopia Spaces
without requiring customization (by administrators) or personalization (by developers).
