# Pre-configured images for itopia Spaces

[These open-source images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?repo_name=spaces-images)
are opinionated configurations (IDEs, CLIs, settings, etc.)
that should enable most developers to be productive in itopia Spaces
with zero customization (by administrators) or personalization (by developers).
