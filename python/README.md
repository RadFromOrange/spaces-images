# Pre-configured Python developer images for itopia Spaces

Each of [these Python developer images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?tab=packages&repo_name=spaces-images&q=python)
provides an opinionated Python development environment (IDE, CLIs, settings, etc.)
for a particular combination of Python version & operating system version,
which should enable most Python developers to be productive in itopia Spaces
without requiring customization (by administrators) or personalization (by developers).

## Python versions

We support the latest patch versions (`all.all.latest`) of all
[current active Python releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
