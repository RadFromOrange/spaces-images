# Pre-configured OpenJDK developer images for itopia Spaces

Each of [these OpenJDK developer images](https://github.com/orgs/itopia-inc/packages?tab=packages&repo_name=spaces-images&q=openjdk)
provides an opinionated OpenJDK development environment (IDE, CLIs, settings, etc.)
for a particular combination of OpenJDK version & operating system version,
which should enable most OpenJDK developers to be productive in itopia Spaces
without requiring customization (by administrators) or personalization (by developers).

## OpenJDK versions

We support all versions of OpenJDK that are
[currently commercially-supported by Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/support.html#roadmap)
